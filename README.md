Module 12 FE Mini-Project: Advanced React E-commerce Web Application.

Welcome to the Advance React E-commerce Web Application!

To begin, please download all items in the repository. Make sure that all folders in the src folder include the files inside. Once downloaded and on VS code, type in 'cd e-commerce-web-app' to get started.


If needed, please install these:
```python
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux react-query axios react-router-dom react-i18next i18next @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest
```

Once everything had been downloaded accordingly, run "npm run dev" to open the development server. Click on the link and it will take you to the development server. Here, you can use the server to login, logout, check the homepage, add items to the shopping cart via the Product Catalog page, and update products in the Products page.

There is a language button in both the Home page and the Shopping Cart page. Click the 'Korean' button will change the language to Korean. The pages are atomically in English.

To test CRUD operations, go to the "__test__" folder and click on the appropriate file. Type in "npm run test" in the terminal. Test will start automatically.

If the test file is not working, type ```python
"npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest" into the terminal.
```
